 *    PURPOSE: To draw text charactors on bitmap only LCD			 *
 *			 These routines define cursor coordinates independant 	 *
 *			 of the two controllers and their coordinates			 *
 *																	 *
 *			 For the 128x64 LCD, this resuls in a 10x4 line display	 *
 *  		 The character set is 12x16 bitmap chars. Bitmaps were 	 *
 *  		 obtained from 											 *
 * http://www.piclist.com/techref/datafile/dCharSet/extractor/font6x8pic8.asm.txt
