/*  What's it need?

	A)  Interrupts on the EOC_ pins (portc).
	To implement:
		Set PCINT0, PCINT1, PCINT2 vectors to the routine.
			ie.  ISR ( PCINT1_vect ) { }
		Setup PCICR (bits 0,1,2)
			For Analog Rev 2, we want PCINT12,13,14,15 which corrresponds to 
									  PORTC 4,5,6,7
				This go in ISR( PCINT1_vect ) {}  
				
		Enable individual pins in PCMSK1 
		
		Look for flag in PCIFR interrupt flag register.
		Look for specific pin in PINC	
		
------------------ done:
	B)	Timesliced operation.				COMPLETED
	C)  Respond to board presence requests.
	C)  CAN Transmitter resistor divider?  NOT NEEDED.
*/

/* To summarize Analog Board CAN :
		After 1 transmit, the can_tx() routine sticks on the "In Use" loop.
		This is because a Bit Error BERR happens.  Therefore no TXOK.		
			ie.  the RX_CAN monitored differed from the TX_CAN sent.
			
		Therefore the transmitter tries again.  Thus the blinking TXBSY.
		
		Observation of the circuit board.
		Transceiver has RX_CAN tied shorted to ground.

	MAYBE CLOCK IS DIFFERENT ON THE BUTTON BOARD!  SO BAUD RATE NOT COMPATIBLE!
	CHECK FUSES.  YES, the button board had the divide by 8 programmed.
	
	Transmit worked!  Showed up on the Tilt boards 0xf0 as all on.
	Why does the Receive Button board not work?  Maybe that was damaged on the transceiver.
		RXCAN was the one tied to +5V.  short power to ground through it's drive transistor. may have zapped it.
		
	Prog other ButtonBoard and see if it receives.
		Yes/No?
